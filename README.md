## SummitSwap

Fully on-chain dex aggregator for EVM chains.
Featuring on-chain aggregation, points earnings, automatic portfolio DCA, and portfolio features

## About

SummitSwap is a set of smart contracts for optimal path finding between two assets and execution of that path. For input&output token and input-amount optimal path should have a greatest net amount-out by considering execution gas-cost.

Search is performed by calling on-chain query-methods and can be called by anyone. However, user should avoid calling query-methods in a mutative call due to a very large gas-cost associated with a call.

## Usage

### Oracle

SummitOracle fetches pricing data, user token data (allowance / balance), and interacts with the router to return essential swapping data.

### Router

SummitRouter is the user-facing interface to check prices and make trades.

#### **findBestPathWithGas**

Finds the best path from tokenA to tokenB. Considers path's amount-out and its gas-cost.

```solidity
function findBestPathWithGas(
  uint256 _amountIn,
  address _tokenIn,
  address _tokenOut,
  uint256 _maxSteps,
  uint256 _gasPrice
) external view returns (FormattedOffer memory);

```

| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| amountIn     | Amount of tokens being sold                                          |
| tokenIn      | ERC20 token being sold                                               |
| tokenOut     | ERC20 token being bought                                             |
| steps        | Max number of steps for path finding (must be less than 4)           |
| gasPrice     | Gas price in gwei that will be used to estimate gasCost of each step |

```solidity
struct FormattedOffer {
  uint256[] amounts;
  address[] adapters;
  address[] path;
  uint256 gasEstimate;
}

```

| Return arg  | Details                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| amounts     | Amount of token being swapped for each step. First amount is `_amountIn` and last `amountOut`.                                                                 |
| adapters    | Addresses of adapters through which trade goes.                                                                                                                |
| path        | Addresses of tokens through which trade goes. First token is `_tokenIn` and last `_tokenOut`.                                                                  |
| gasEstimate | Rough estimate for gas-cost of all swaps. Gas estimates only include gas-cost of swapping and querying on adapter and not intermediate logic, nor tx-gas-cost. |

#### **swapNoSplit**

Executes trades through provided path.

```solidity
function swapNoSplit(
  Trade calldata _trade,
  address _to,
  uint256 _fee
) external;

```

| Input param | Details                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| \_trade     | Arguments used for swapping                 |
| \_to        | Reciever address                            |
| \_fee       | Optional fee in bps taken before the trades |

```solidity
struct Trade {
  uint256 amountIn;
  uint256 amountOut;
  address[] path;
  address[] adapters;
}

```

| Param     | Details                                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| amountIn  | Amount of tokens being sold                                      |
| amountOut | Amount of tokens being bought                                    |
| path      | Tokens being traded in respective order                          |
| adapters  | Adapters through which tokens will be traded in respective order |

### Adapter

Adapters act as a common interface for SummitRouter to interact with external contracts.

Adapters offers methods: `query` and `swap`.

```solidity
function query(
  uint256 _amountIn,
  address _tokenIn,
  address _tokenOut
) external view returns (uint256);

function swap(
  uint256 _amountIn,
  uint256 _amountOut,
  address _fromToken,
  address _toToken,
  address _to
) external;

```

After setting up this repo call `npx hardhat list-adapters --network {network-id}` to get a list of live adapters and their addresses. Or see [`deployOptions`](./src/misc/deployOptions.js) for a list of live adapters per chain.
